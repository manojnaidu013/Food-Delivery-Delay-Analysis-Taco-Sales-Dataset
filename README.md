# 🧾 Food Delivery Delay Analysis – Taco Sales Dataset
This project analyzes one year of taco delivery data to uncover patterns and factors contributing to delivery delays. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and visual storytelling using Tableau dashboards.
# 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
Python: pandas, datetime

Jupyter Notebook: for data exploration and transformation

Tableau: for interactive visualizations and dashboarding

Google Colab: notebook environment

# 📊 Key Steps & Features
# Data Cleaning

Converted raw Order Time and Delivery Time to datetime format

Calculated Delivery Duration (min) for each order

# Feature Engineering

Created new columns like Delivery Status, Hour of Day, and Day of Week

Classified orders as On Time or Delayed based on a 30-minute threshold

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Investigated delivery trends by time, day, distance, location, taco type, and tips

Used plots to uncover peak delay periods and possible causes

# Tableau Dashboard

Built an interactive dashboard with filters for:

Day of week, restaurant, taco type, and delivery status

Visualized KPIs, hourly delay trends, and distance/duration patterns

# 🔍 Insights Discovered
Peak delivery delays occur during lunch and dinner rush hours

Weekends see a significantly higher rate of delayed orders

Longer distances and lower tips correlate with late deliveries

Customers tip more when orders are delivered on time
